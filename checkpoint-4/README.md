# Checkpoint 4 : Graph Analysis

### Summary
---
To run this, open CP4.ipynb in a [Colaboratory window](https://colab.research.google.com/). Then, upload all the contents of our data folder into the Google Colab Files folder. This can be found on the left side of the window by clicking on the file icon. Then, you can select 'Run all' from the 'Runtime' menu and wait for all of the code to run. Finally, all of the data and graphs will be outputted with the civilian complaints first, then the officer complaints. The implications are discussed further in the analysis.
